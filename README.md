# productsapp
This app is developed for CodeLouisville JavaScipt with React class.
My first app prototype for displaying list of products. I am using jsonplaceholder API data for testing my app.
The app has "Add Product" and "Delete this Product" options.
Need to run rpm start to view in the web browser.
